# Smart Contract Insurance - Clarity Smart Contract

This repository contains a Clarity smart contract implementing a basic insurance system for other smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

The Smart Contract Insurance system allows other contracts (or users) to purchase insurance, file claims, and receive payouts if their claims are approved. The contract manages an insurance pool and keeps track of insured contracts and pending claims.

## Features

- Purchase insurance
- File claims
- Approve and pay out claims
- Check insurance pool balance
- Verify if a contract is insured
- Get insured amount for a contract
- Get claim amount for a contract

## Contract Functions

### Public Functions

1. `purchase-insurance`: Allow a contract to purchase insurance by sending STX to the insurance pool.
2. `file-claim`: File a claim for an insured contract.
3. `approve-claim`: Approve and pay out a claim (restricted to contract owner).

### Read-Only Functions

1. `get-pool-balance`: Get the current balance of the insurance pool.
2. `is-insured`: Check if a contract is insured.
3. `get-insured-amount`: Get the insured amount for a specific contract.
4. `get-claim-amount`: Get the claim amount for a specific contract.

## Usage

To use this smart contract, deploy it to the Stacks blockchain and interact with it using the provided functions. Make sure to have the necessary STX balance when purchasing insurance or approving claims.

## Security Considerations

- This is a basic implementation and should not be used in production without thorough auditing and testing.
- Security updating
- The `approve-claim` function should be properly secured to prevent unauthorized claim approvals.
- Consider implementing additional checks and balances, such as claim verification mechanisms and tiered insurance plans.
